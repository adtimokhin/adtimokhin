## ðŸ‘‹ Hello

I'm Aleksandr Timokhin, a student at the University of Chicago studying Economics and Public Policy. I work on full-stack development projects, focusing primarily on backend systems and web infrastructure. Most of my work is done in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and modern frontend frameworks like React and Next.js.

### ðŸ§± Development Focus

- **Full-Stack Applications**  
  I build structured, component-based projects using tools like:
  - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) + [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  - [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for ORM-based modeling
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for auth and real-time sync

- **Infrastructure Tools**  
  I've built internal tools and bots using:
  - [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
  - CLI automation with `argparse`, scheduling, and file I/O
  - Chromium-based scraping with screenshot capture

- **Exchange & Matching Systems (In Progress)**  
  Exploring backend systems for custom financial exchanges (e.g. matching engines, OMS vs ME architecture).  
  Focus includes Kafka pipelines, in-memory caching strategies, and persistent trade logs.
